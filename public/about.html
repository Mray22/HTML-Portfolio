<h1>About Me:</h1>

<p>
  My name is Manaury Reyes and I have a passion for Cybersecurity and Software
  Engineering.

  I was born and raised in the Bronx, NY. Both of my parents are immigrants from
  the Dominican Republic. My dad was always into technology and different
  electronic gadgets which is where my curiousity of knowing how things work
  came from. Along with those curiousities, I also fell in love with the way
  someone can make something come alive from nothing into something with just
  understanding the technical mechanics of it and make it beautiful again. Which
  is why I think I would go with my uncle to his job shadow him in his mechanic
  shop. I would help out to learn how cars work since it was so detailed and
  complicated. But I was very impressed with how my uncle would take a few
  minutes staring at a car and know what was wrong with it and fix it. Those
  were the moments that led to me falling in love with cars. Since I was so
  young and curious about everything, if I had an idea about something I would
  want to see how it looks right away therefore I would just draw it. This is
  where my passion for art came from.

  I went to HS of Art and Design in NYC. I became naturally good at it but even
  though I was in a art school, I still craved that challenge I would get when I
  was around cars with my uncle or learning about technology with my dad why Is
  why I majored in Architecture. After a while I realized that Architecture
  wasn't fun anymore. My excitment for cars and art was always in me. For those
  reasons I enrolled in a technical school as a AutoBody Technician. I completed
  it and the love for Art and Cars grew even more. I started working as a
  Technician but the hours and the dust started to take a toll on my health. I
  still love it but more as a hobby. Another thing I was very good at was
  working with computers. Always working on computers since my school received
  macintosh computers and working on computers was also something I would do
  with my dad. I enrolled in Westchester Community College as a Cybersecurity
  Major and I graduated with an Associate Degree. I love how Technology is able
  to combine Art and Complexity with in one while being able to maintaining a
  good work life balance.
